    Ostiary is a security gem for your (rails) controllers & actions.
    It employs a before_filter-like call to set policies per controller/action.
    You can pass your own security call in block and handle the PolicyBroken
    yourself.
    Policies are also inherited from parent classes.
    From wikipedia: "An ostiarius, a Latin word sometimes anglicized as ostiary
    but often literally translated as porter or doorman, originally was a
    servant or guard posted at the entrance of a building. See also gatekeeper."
